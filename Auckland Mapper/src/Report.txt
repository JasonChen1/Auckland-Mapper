I done core and completion

In the roadGraph class i have a aStartSearch method which finds the routes and the redraw method which draws the routes.
in the method first i set all the nodes to not visited then i create a PriorityQueue which contains the object which contains
start nodes, the goal node the cost of the current node to its neighbour and the estimate cost from the start node to the
goal node(the cost of the start node to the goal node as a straight line). If the queue is not empty it will poll the value 
of the queue first then check it and see if its visited if not set it to visited and set the pathfrom variable to that node
if the node is equal to goal then exit else go through its neighbor if the neighbor is not visited then set it to visited 
then calculate the cost from the node to its neighbor and the total cost then add to the queue.

I have a artPoint method which finds the articulation points of the map and highlight it with a different colour.
in the method first i set all the node's depth to infinity and create a empty set, then i set the start node's depth and the 
number of subtree to 0 then i go through each neighbour of the start node and check the depth of the neighbours if its infinity
then i call the recursive method which takes the current node depth and the from node to account in the recursive method it first 
set the node's depth and the reachBack's depth to the depth that the artPoint method past in  the it go through each neighbour 
of that node other than fromNode and check it if the neighbour's depth is less than infinity if it true then find the 
min(neighbour.depth, reachBack), else call the method itself and past in (neighbour,depth+1,node) and store it to a variable childReach
after this then set the reachBack to min(childReach,reachBack) if childReach>= depth then add to the set and return it.
after returning it, it go back to the artPoint method and increment the number of subtree's count and check that if the 
number of subtree is >1 then add the start node to the set

I test the program by check the drawing of the shortest path and the drawing of the articulation point
